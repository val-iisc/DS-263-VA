      <h2>Brief description of the course</h2>

      <div class="entry">

<p>The goal of machine vision is to develop methods that enable a machine to “understand” or analyze images and videos. This course will address the research issues towards developing algorithms that can perform high-level visual recognition tasks on real-world images and videos. This course will review and discuss current approaches to high-level visual recognition problems, such as background modeling, object recognition and categorization, tracking, scene understanding, human motion understanding, etc. This course is intended for graduate level students.
