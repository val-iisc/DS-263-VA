<p>There is no prescribed textbook for this course. However, We hope that the following book would be very useful guides along the course:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications, by Rick Szeliski. A free electronic copy is available online (<a href="http://szeliski.org/Book/">Link</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Additional Resources would be released along with the Lectures.</p>
