<p>There is no prescribed textbook for this course. However, We hope that the following books would be very useful guides along the course:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville</li>
<li>Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Michael Nielson</li>
</ol>
<p>Additional Resources would be released along with the Lectures.</p>
